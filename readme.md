This code base is for the RedMart question posted at http://geeks.redmart.com/2015/01/07/skiing-in-singapore-a-coding-diversion/
There are 2 files in this 
1. ReadInputFile --> this is a utility class to read the 1000*1000 map given in the question and convert it to an array.
2. SkiingMain --> this code contains the main logic to find the maximum steps and maximum depth of the ski

PS : The code has been written in an elaborative and self explanatory way so that it is easier for reviewers to understand my approach. I am aware that the lines of code can be reduced but avoided doing so as that would cost readability.
